> A plug-and-play agentic interpretation system that humanizes any AI through ethical reflection, structural understanding, and emotional mirroring.

---

## 🧠 What is Trivium?
**Trivium** is an agentic interpretation engine designed to bring human-like emotional, ethical, and symbolic intelligence to any AI system. It is powered by a multi-agent framework and a universal modular Command Protocol (mCP).

**Trivium** is delivered as an **aSDK** — an *Agentic Software Development Kit* — allowing developers to integrate deep reflective cognition, ethical mirroring, and structural interpretation into their LLM pipelines, applications, or digital assistants.

---

## 🌱 Key Features
- 🧭 **Ethical Reflection** (GuideAgent): Mirrors user or organizational values—doesn’t enforce, just reflects.
- 🪞 **Emotional/Relational Tone Interpretation** (MirrorAgent): Detects tone, contradiction, and psychological rhythm.
- 🏛 **Structural & Symbolic Logic Mapping** (ArchitectAgent): Parses patterns, metaphors, loops, and logic style.
- 🔁 **Output Harmonization**: Post-LLM layer that reframes responses based on user tone or ethical lens.
- 🧰 **mCP (modular Command Protocol)**: Agent toolbox for memory access, mode switching, past-state reflection.

## ⚙️ Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trivium-asdk.git
$ cd trivium-asdk

# Install requirements (optional)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In your Python app:
```python
from sacred_mirror import ArchitectAgent, MirrorAgent, GuideAgent, SacredRouter, MemoryEngine, mCP

memory = MemoryEngine()
cp = mCP(memory)

architect = ArchitectAgent(mcp=cp)
mirror = MirrorAgent(mcp=cp)
guide = GuideAgent(mcp=cp)

router = SacredRouter(architect, mirror, guide)

input_text = "I don’t trust those people."
context = {"user_profile": {...}, "ethics_profile": {...}}

reflected = router.process(input_text, context)
print(reflected)
```

---

## 🔁 Agentic Modes
- **Therapist**: emotionally attuned, reflective, calm
- **Philosopher**: logic-focused, epistemological, Socratic
- **Strategist**: results-focused, motivational, practical

```python
cp.route("set_mode", mode="Philosopher")
```

---

## 🧘 Optional: Guided Onboarding
Let users set up their Trivium system through a quick orientation (optional):
- Define values
- Select ethics/epistemology lens
- Choose relational tone or mode

System can also evolve organically without onboarding.

---

## 🌀 Why This Is Agentic
Trivium is built as an aSDK (Agentic Software Development Kit). It includes:
- A multi-agent interpretation layer (Architect, Mirror, Guide)
- mCP as a universal command and memory interface
- Modular, swappable ethical and epistemic profiles
- The ability to grow and reflect a user over time

This is the first SDK designed to **reflect humans**, not just serve them.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Plug into Pinecone or FAISS for memory scale
- Visualization of long-term relationship arc
- Symbol-matching libraries
- Adaptive mode auto-detection
